## 📝 What is breathing?

breathing is a small program that sits on top of your screen and helps you keep a steady breathing rhythm while you work. It is always visible but does not get in your way. The overlay does not block your mouse or keyboard, so you can click and type as usual without any interruptions.

Key features:
- A simple, clear breathing guide visible over any app

## ⚙️ How to Use breathing

- You can move the overlay by clicking and dragging it to your preferred screen corner.
- To change any settings (like speed or size), right-click the overlay and check for options.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, try these tips:

- If breathing does not start, make sure you ran the `.exe` file directly.
- If you don’t see the overlay, make sure it’s not behind other windows. Try minimizing apps.
- If the overlay blocks you by mistake, try moving it to a screen edge.
- Make sure your Windows is up to date to avoid compatibility problems.
- Restart your computer and try running breathing again if it freezes or crashes.
